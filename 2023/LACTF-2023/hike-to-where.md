### Challenge Description

Where was this photo taken? I think it used to be in the original photo, but someone cropped it out!

The flag is lactf{location}, where location is the name of the POI that this person hiked up to, all lowercase and replacing spaces with underscrolls. Use the google maps name of the POI: for example, if the solution is the UCLA Bruin Bear statue, [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/UCLA+Bruin+Statue/@34.0709817,-118.4451726,21z) is the google maps location, and the flag would be `lactf{bruin_statue}`.

Please note: contacting anyone or any organization beyond official LA CTF support channels regarding this challenge is against the rules. Please be respectful of those who are involved in this challenge.
