### Solution

Immediately we notice the ornaments, the text, and the banners (possibly to indicate some sort-of event or celebration). 

We can use a reverse image search and the text from the banners can be translated:

```
Heisei 14
Naritasan Fukagawa
The 300 Years of Creation
```

What can we find by searching for `Naritasan Fukagawa`?

From the above image we notice identical flags and pillar decorations.
